### Learning Objectives: 
Learn a new style of React and Redux

### Goals: 
Tick off my goal of building a mobile friendly shopping cart

### Todos: 
Expand this into a full template for a mobile friendly store front

### Reflections: 
The redux work was light, but I focused more on learning the new style of redux (using types.js). React BootStrap was also some much needed revision. When I first visited React Bootstrap it looked harder than it needed to be. Now I realize exactly how it works and how flexible the props really are.
